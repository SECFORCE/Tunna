SUMMARY
=======

	TLDR: Tunnels Metasploit Payload (TCP) connections over HTTP

In a fully firewalled (inbound and outbound connections restricted - except the webserver port)

The exploit generates the payload, uploads it to the server and executes it using the webshell.

The webshell is used to connect to the payload running on the remote host. 
This would be a local connection on a local port at the remote host and *should* be allowed by the firewall.

The webshell will read data from the payload port wrap them over HTTP and send it as an HTTP response to the
metasploit "proxy".

The local metasploit "proxy" will unwrap and write the data to its local port where the payload handler 
is connected.

When the metasploit "proxy" receives data on the local port, it will send them over to the webshell 
as a HTTP Post.

The webshell will read the data from the HTTP Post and put them on the payload port

and repeat --^

Only the webserver port needs to be open (typically 80 - *not really tested over 443 SSL)
The whole communication (Externally) is done over the HTTP protocol

Module advanced options:

   Name           : BufferSize **
   Current Setting: 8192
   Description    : HTTP request size (some webshels have limitations on the size)

   Name           : RemoteAddress

example usage:
	use exploit/windows/misc/http_prx_exploit
	set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/bind_tcp 
	set VERBOSE true
	set RHOST 10.3.3.7
	set TARGETURI http://10.3.3.1/conn.aspx
	
**	exploit -j

wait for session 
	sessions -i $(session number)	

** See Limitations 

Prerequisites
=============
	Copy the exploit file at ~/.msf4/modules/exploits/windows/misc/http_prx_exploit.rb
	or
	Copy the exploit file at ~/.msf4/modules/exploits/linux/misc/http_prx_exploit.rb
	or wherever

	The ability to upload a webshell on the remote server


LIMITATIONS / KNOWN BUGS / HACKS
================================
	
	This is a POC code and might cause DoS of the server.
		All efforts to clean up after execution or on error have been made ... no promises
		There are some known bugs

	Important!:
		* It needs to be run as a job (exploit -j)
			otherwise the socket threads get killed (program exits) when the handler is executed
		* There is a bug in metasploit and local sockets - Bug #7760
			Affected the development of the module greatly
			! RHOST needs to be set to the local external IP or won't work
			LPORT: a local available port for the metasploit handler needs to be set as well 

		* RHOST: when overloaded (in code) the handler couldn't connect.
		* Theoretically reverse payloads can be used (UNTESTED and not recommended)
			but StartPing needs to be set to TRUE
		* The correct PAYLOAD for the remote OS should be selected
		* Sometimes the pinging thread doesn't get killed - better to close the remote connection 1st 

	Based on local tests: 	
		* Most tests done with PAYLOAD (but others should work):
			windows/meterpreter/bind_tcp	
			and
			linux/x86/meterpreter/bind_tcp
			
		* JSP buffer needs to be limited (BufferSize option):
				4096 worked in Linux Apache Tomcat
				1024 worked in XAMPP Apache Tomcat (slow)
				* More than that created problems with bytes missing at the remote socket
				eg: set BufferSize 1024

		* Sockets not enabled by default php windows (IIS + PHP)
		
		* Return cariages on webshells (outside the code): 
			get sent on responses / get written on local socket --> corrupt the packets

		* PHP webshell for windows: the loop function DoS'es the remote socket: 
			sleep function added -> works but a bit slow

	
FILES
=====

	Webshells:
		conn.jsp		Tested on Apache Tomcat (windows + linux)
		conn.aspx		Tested on IIS 6+8 (windows server 2003/2012) 
		conn.php		Tested on LAMP + XAMPP + IIS (windows + linux)

	Module:
		http_prx_exploit.rb	Tested in backtrack 5 / metasploit v4.3.0-dev [core:4.3 api:1.0]


Technical Details
=================
	* The code is in a Pre-alpha dev stage:
		more work with the exceptions & at exit cleanup is needed


 Architecture descisions
 -----------------------
	Have the all the code included in one module
		Also tried to make it a handler module but this works better

	Tried to use Metasploits API as much as possible
	
	Local port is needed for handler connection
		Internal (double) socket was not possible

	VERBOSE ouput that gets restricted when meterpreter is connected

	General:	
	Data is sent raw in the HTTP Post Body (no post variable)
		To save a couple of bytes

	Instructions / configuration is sent to the webshell as URL parameters (HTTP Get)
	Data is sent in the HTTP body (HTTP Post)

	Websockets not used: Not supported by default by most of webservers (Maybe futrure dev)
	Asyncronous HTTP responses not really possible
		Proxy queries the server constantly (default 0.5 seconds)


 INITIATION PHASE
 ----------------
1st packet initiates a session with the webshell - gets a cookie back
	eg: http://webserver/conn.ext?proxy 	

Based on the specified payload an executable gets generated (masfpayload code)
	It gets uploaded to the webservers temp directory on the remote host
	It gets executed by the webserver

2nd packet sends connection configuration options to the webshell
	eg: http://webserver/conn.ext?proxy&port=4444&ip=127.0.0.1
	
	IP and port of the payload for the webshell to connect to
	This is a threaded request:
		In php this request will go into an infinate loop 
		to keep the webshell socket connection alive
		In other webshells [OK] is received back

 PROXY
 -----
The handler is called with the localhost(RHOST)/LPORT settings
Typically the handler connects to the local socket and sends the payload stage
session is created on the background
to interact with the session: sessions -i $(session number)

Once the handler is connected the pinging thread is initiated and execution starts.

Any data on the socket (from the client) get read and get sent as a HTTP Post request
Any data on the webshell socket get sent as a response to the POST request

 PINGING THREAD
 --------------
Because HTTP responses cannot be asyncronous. 
This thread will do HTTP Get requests on the webshell based on an interval (default 0.5 sec)
If the webshell has data to send, it will (also) send it as a reply to this request
Otherwise it sends an empty response

In general:
	Data from the local proxy get send with HTTP Post
	There are Get requests every 0.5 sec to query the webshell for data
	If there is data on the webshell side get send over as a response to one of these requests	

 WEBSHELL
 --------
if url parameter file&upload is set it reads the executable and stores it on the temp
if url parameter file&run is received: runs the executable
	In linux chmod +x is needed
if url parameter file&delete: deletes the executable (at exit)
The webshell connects to the payload socket on the local host. 
Any data written on the socket get sent back to the proxy as a reply to a request (POST/GET)
Any data received with a post get written to the socket.

 NOTES
 -----
All requests need to have the URL parameter "proxy" set to be handled by the webshell
	(http://webserver/conn.ext?proxy)

 AT EXIT / AT ERROR
 ------------------
Tries to kill all threads and close socket
	* Doesn't always work as expected
Sends proxy&close to webshell:
	Kills remote threads and closes socket
